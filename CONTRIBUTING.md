## Branching

Every branch should start with `fuck/`

Example: `fuck/animation-overhaul`

## Commits

Every commit message should have the prefix `fuck:`

Always add add an additional fuck somewhere else in the commit message

Example: `fucK: rename the fucking file`

## Notes

Honestly just use the word fuck as much as possible and I'll probably merge your pull request.
